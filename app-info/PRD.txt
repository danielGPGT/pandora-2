1. Executive Summary
1.1 Product Vision
The Enterprise Sports Event Tour Operator Platform is a comprehensive SaaS solution designed to revolutionize how tour operators manage and sell sports event travel packages. The platform enables operators to efficiently manage complex multi-component packages (accommodation, tickets, transfers, flights, experiences) while providing flexibility for both B2C e-commerce and B2B sales workflows.
1.2 Product Overview
A multi-tenant platform supporting F1, MotoGP, football, tennis, golf, and other sports event tour operators with:

Component-based package builder with flexible pricing (cost + markup model)
Multi-inventory management (contracted, free-sell, buy-to-order)
Dual business models (e-commerce and sales/quote-based)
Operational management tools for rooming lists, manifests, and supplier coordination
Corporate hospitality features for B2B clients
Multi-currency support with exchange rate management

1.3 Business Impact
Revenue Goals:

Enable operators to manage 5x more bookings with existing staff
Reduce booking processing time by 70%
Increase package upsell by 30% through better component visibility
Reduce operational errors by 80%

Market Opportunity:

Sports event travel market: $23B globally (2024)
Target: 500+ tour operators in Year 1
Average contract value: $50K-$250K/year


2. Problem Statement
2.1 Current Industry Challenges
For Tour Operators:

Manual processes: Spreadsheets, emails, fragmented systems lead to errors and inefficiency
Limited flexibility: Can't easily create custom packages or adapt to changing inventory
Poor visibility: No real-time inventory tracking across accommodation, tickets, transfers
Scalability issues: Can't grow without proportionally increasing staff
Payment tracking chaos: Manual reconciliation of deposits, balances, supplier payments
Operational nightmares: Rooming lists, manifests, supplier confirmations done manually

For Customers:

Slow quote turnaround (24-48 hours typical)
Limited package customization options
Poor booking experience (forms, emails, phone calls)
Lack of transparency on availability and pricing

2.2 Market Gap
Existing solutions fail because they:

Are built for general travel (not sports events)
Don't handle complex multi-component packages
Lack free-sell/provisional inventory models
Don't support both B2C and B2B workflows
Have poor operational tools for tour management

Our solution addresses this gap by:

Being purpose-built for sports event tour operators
Supporting all inventory models (contracted, free-sell, buy-to-order)
Enabling flexible component-based packages
Supporting both e-commerce and sales team workflows
Providing comprehensive operational management

## **15. Risks & Mitigations**

### **15.1 Technical Risks**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|

| **Scope creep delays launch** | High | High | Strict prioritization; defer non-MVP features; regular stakeholder alignment |
| **Insufficient customer support** | Medium | Medium | Build self-service documentation; hire support team early; use ticketing system |
| **Data migration failures** | Medium | Medium | Provide migration tools; offer white-glove service; thorough testing |

### **15.4 Compliance Risks**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **GDPR non-compliance** | Low | Critical | Legal review; implement required features (data export, deletion); privacy policy |
| **PCI DSS non-compliance** | Low | High | Use tokenization (Stripe); never store card details; annual audit |
| **Data breach** | Low | Critical | Encryption (transit & rest); access controls; incident response plan |
| **SOC 2 audit failure** | Medium | High | Start preparation early; hire compliance expert; use compliance tools |
